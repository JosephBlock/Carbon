    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates or sets an environment variable.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Uses the .NET [Environment class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z8te35sa) to create or set an environment variable in the Process, User, or Machine scopes.
    
    Changes to environment variables in the User and Machine scope are not picked up by running processes.  Any running processes that use this environment variable should be restarted.

    Normally, you have to restart your PowerShell session/process to see the variable in the `env:` drive. Use the `-Force` switch to also add the variable to the `env:` drive. This functionality was added in Carbon 2.3.0.

    .EXAMPLE
    Set-EnvironmentVariable -Name 'MyEnvironmentVariable' -Value 'Value1' -ForProcess
    
    Creates the `MyEnvironmentVariable` with an initial value of `Value1` in the process scope, i.e. the variable is only accessible in the current process.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Set-EnvironmentVariable -Name 'MyEnvironmentVariable' -Value 'Value1' -ForComputer
    
    Creates the `MyEnvironmentVariable` with an initial value of `Value1` in the machine scope, i.e. the variable is accessible in all newly launched processes.
